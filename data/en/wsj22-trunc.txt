the DT group NN 's POS advisers NNS want VBP to TO make VB certain JJ they PRP have VBP firm JJ bank NN commitments NNS the DT second JJ time NN around RB . .
even RB if IN the DT buy-out NN group NN is VBZ able JJ to TO obtain VB financing NN , , the DT transaction NN still RB faces VBZ obstacles NNS . .
